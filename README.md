# GIDSOpenStandaarden-SecurityFramework
Security documents for organizations that make use of GIDS Open Standaarden open source components.

## Introduction
GIDS Open Standards connects eHealth tools across the domains of health, social well-being and care. In addition, the organizations that use GIDS Open Standards vary greatly in size and expertise. 

For example, through GIDS Open Standaarden open source components both large treatment platforms for healthcare and small websites in the social domain that are set up for a local neighborhood are integrated.

At the same time, the users and the organizations that use the open source components mutually trust that all participants have a good safety policy. Existing safety frameworks such as ISO27000 and NEN7510 are not flexible enough to regulate such a diverse field.

That is why GIDS Open Standards has its own [security framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ulbKb2Q8BEXQdv_ntWEXFo7TXBzgjWDaClxkHsQJoU/edit?usp=sharing).

## This security framework uses a number of principles:
- The framework must encourage an effective security policy and make it visible what is being done about security. To this end, it not only looks at the measures taken, but also at the context of use and the organization.
- The framework must encourage openness. Openness increases the mutual trust of users and organizations and makes it possible for organizations to support each other in improving their safety.
- The framework must be accessible and also support small organizations with little knowledge in the field of security in setting up a good security policy.
- The framework must be in line with the legal requirements that apply to the activities of the specific organizations. Dutch examples of such laws are: the AVG, the WGBO, the Medical Devices Regulation, the Electronic Data Exchange in Healthcare Act, etc.
- The framework should not result in duplication of work for organizations that already have their own safety management system (for example from the ISO 27000 or NEN7510 family).
- The framework must, with peer review, be mutually verifiable by the organizations.
- The framework must be verifiable, if an organization does not meet a set of minimum requirements, this must also be made clear.

This security framework is loosely based on the “ISSA-UK 5173, Information Security for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises” standard. The framework follows, where relevant, the same categories and structure as ISSA-UK 5173. This is further completed with items from the OWASP top-10 and NEN7510-1 / 2.

This framework differs on one point from the requirements set by the ISO27001 or NEN7510-1 standards. Risk management, point 3 in this standard, is explicitly split into two separate steps: mapping out at a high level which threats are relevant to the target group (point 3a) and on that basis filling in which incidents can actually occur (point 3b).

This division has been chosen to ensure that risk management is actually in line with the very diverse target groups that use GIDS Open Standards open source components. An organization that is already ISO27001 or NEN7510-1 certified will have to check whether this is sufficiently effective in risk management.
